            Hi, my name is Naiyou Wang. I’m studying Industrial and Interaction design as my first major and information management and technology as the second major. I’m really interested in UI/UX design, so I’m focused on interaction and web development. I learned many programs such as photoshop, adobe illustrator, and figma. I feel all these tools help me get a direction of what I want to pursue. Besides that, I also learned the design research methods, as well as the way to communicate with others.
Outside of school, I’d like to go swimming and drawing for relax. Sometimes, I do play video games as well, which will direct me to another exciting world. I believe life should be balanced with work and entertainment.
